# KLM Engine

Small standalone Go HTTP engine for real projects, sessions, and delegated harness
execution. Go 1.24.2, with `go-gitignore` for project path discovery. Includes a private linked-agent MCP
bridge; no frontend or general-purpose engine MCP interface is bundled.

## Run

From this directory, in PowerShell, build a persistent executable before starting:

```powershell
go build -o klm.exe .
.\klm.exe start
.\klm.exe stop
```

The public CLI has only `klm start` and `klm stop`. Start launches a detached worker,
waits for readiness and returns; repeated start keeps the same engine. Closing the
terminal does not stop it. Stop uses a per-user Windows named pipe, waits for the
live pipe server's Windows process handle and data lock to be released after shutdown,
and is idempotent when stopped.
It never kills a process from a stored PID or exposes engine shutdown on HTTP.
`__worker` is an internal launch mode, not an additional public command.

- API listen address is fixed at `0.0.0.0:7331`. Port conflicts are errors.
- Data stays at `%APPDATA%\klm\engine`; `engine.log` captures background output.
- The same exclusive data-directory lock protects existing data and live instances.
- Shutdown cancels active harness work and records interruption without run replay.
- Packaged binaries resolve adjacent `prompts/` before development source paths.
  Pi's extension and OpenCode's graph plugin are embedded in the Go binary.
- The separate NSIS installer configures user PATH and HKCU Run login startup,
  starts the engine and preserves user data on uninstall. It does not install
  harnesses. See [Windows packaging](../distribution/windows/README.md).
- The Tauri client has its own installer and lifecycle; the engine serves no UI.

## HTTP Contract
Development builds use `go build -tags dev -o klm-dev.exe .`, then
`.\klm-dev.exe start` / `.\klm-dev.exe stop`. This selects API **17331**, Focus
origin port **17332**, and `%APPDATA%\klm\engine-dev` for data, logs, locks and
the derived local control channel. Release builds omit the tag and retain
**7331/7332** and `%APPDATA%\klm\engine`. Both can run concurrently.


All mutation requests, including stop and directory picker, require
`Content-Type: application/json`. Stop and picker accept an empty body or `{}`.
Other mutation bodies are a single JSON object; unknown fields are rejected.
Errors are non-2xx JSON objects: `{"error":"message"}`.

Adding the same directory again restores a removed project's identity, folders,
and session history with the name and icon chosen in the add dialog.

}
```

### File and folder mentions

Both composers use confirmed `@path` selections (`@path/` for directories).
`mentions` is optional for backward compatibility. Each occurrence has its own
opaque `id`, normalized slash-separated project-relative `path`, `kind` (`file`
or `directory`), and half-open `[start,end)` **UTF-16 code-unit offsets** into the
exact untrimmed `text`. The range must match the full token. Offsets are not UTF-8
bytes and are unrelated to Codex `text_elements`. Ordinary text is never scanned
to implicitly attach paths.

Discovery works before harness startup and during active turns. An empty query
lists root entries. Name/prefix, path, substring, then simple subsequence matches
are ranked, with at most 40 results. Traversal is bounded to 20,000 entries, 64
directory levels, and a cooperative 300 ms deadline per request (individual OS
I/O calls can take longer). Reaching a traversal or result limit sets `partial`.
Nested `.gitignore` rules are parsed through `go-gitignore`, without requiring Git
or a repository. Ignore files are limited to 128 KiB; unreadable/oversized rules
skip that subtree and mark discovery partial. `.git` metadata is excluded.
Contained links may be selected, but directory links are not traversed during
discovery. The client debounces queries and discards obsolete responses.

At submission the engine derives the root from the session's project, resolves
links/junctions, checks containment and types, and opens through `os.Root` for
bounded reads. Absolute paths, traversal, Windows devices/alternate streams,
external links, and nonregular files are rejected. Up to eight unique canonical
paths and 256 occurrences are accepted, with case-insensitive canonical path
deduplication on Windows. All occurrences remain in `Event.data.mentions`.

Only UTF-8 text files and directories are supported; binary data, images, and PDFs
produce explicit errors. Text validation inspects the bounded prefix that can be
attached, not the unread tail of an oversized file. Empty files/directories work.
Files are read when sending, never by the frontend or during autocomplete. A retry
reads again; multiple files are not an atomic filesystem snapshot.

| Harness | Delivery |
| --- | --- |
| OpenCode | One text part plus deduplicated native `file:` parts (`text/plain` or `application/x-directory`) in `prompt_async`. OpenCode does materialization; no duplicate Go-expanded content. |
| Pi | The prepared JSON attachment block is appended to the same RPC `prompt.message`. |
| Codex | The prepared JSON attachment block is a second `type: "text"` item in `turn/start.input`; both items use `text_elements: []`. |

Pi/Codex preparation limits are 2,000 lines and 50 KiB per file, 2,000 Unicode
characters per line, and 2,000 immediate entries/50 KiB per directory. Individual
directory names are JSON-quoted, subdirectories end in `/`, and links are marked
`[link]`. Directory attachments include real children even if ignored in discovery;
no recursive content is read. Oversized directories contain a sorted bounded
subset of the OS enumeration, with truncation indicated. Blocks use JSON-escaped
paths/content plus a `truncated` flag. The entire serialized context, including
escaping and framing, is limited to 200 KiB; exceeding it rejects the submission
instead of dropping attachments. OpenCode retains its native Read limits and
reports native preparation errors through the existing harness error flow.

`Event.text` remains the original message. `Event.data.mentionPreparation` holds
`{path,kind,mode,bytes?,truncated?}` per unique reference. `mode: "prepared"` records
Go preparation, not delivery success. `mode: "native"` makes no claim about native
materialization size or success. Sources coexist with both fields. Native histories
hold the expanded context; KLM state does not duplicate large attachment snapshots.
The chat renders reference badges inline with the text, showing only file/folder
names. The editor keeps badges atomic and maps their DOM positions to the full
canonical token's UTF-16 offsets. Deleting a badge removes the reference. Known
truncation is marked on its badge; expanded content stays in native history.

Preparation runs outside the application lock and precedes acceptance. The engine
rechecks session/project/harness and the absence of a running turn before committing.
The existing 128 KiB user-text, 512 KiB HTTP body, and 2 MiB transport/frame limits
remain; the final escaped prompt (including side-chat sources and linked-tool
prefix) is checked with 16 KiB reserved for protocol envelopes and metadata.
Preparation errors preserve the draft and do not start a turn. Native failures
after acceptance remain visible as harness errors. Subsequent linked consultations
and continuations do not reattach earlier files. Tool permissions are unchanged.

#### Manual acceptance checklist

Run in main and side chats with Pi, OpenCode, and Codex:

1. Attach a small file with a unique marker. Inspect the native prompt/history to
   confirm the content was present before any model-decided Read call.
2. Attach a directory containing files and a subdirectory; confirm immediate names,
   including ignored children, without recursive file contents.
3. Mix multiple files/folders, repeat a reference, and combine side-chat passages.
   Confirm one content inclusion per canonical path and all visible occurrences.
4. Exercise spaces, accents, emoji/Unicode before references, mid-text edits,
   replacing/removing tokens, keyboard/click selection, IME, and session switching.
   Enter with suggestions open selects and never sends; Shift+Enter/Ctrl+J insert
   newlines; Escape closes suggestions.
5. Try empty files/folders, truncation, an oversized aggregate, removed files, and
   binary files. Confirm explicit errors/truncation and preserved drafts on rejection.
6. Reopen history and check references and sources, then send plain text and linked
   consultations/continuations. Confirm ordinary permissions still work.

Implementation validation uses an engine build to temporary output and the desktop
production build. Native turn behavior and installed-harness compatibility still
require the manual checks above; builds alone do not establish them.

## Agent and Graph Files

The authoring CRUD is independent of graph execution and of the chat graph selector.
Files live in the selected project's `.klm/agents` and `.klm/graphs`, which are
created on demand. No `harness.toml` is created. See
[`GRAPH_AUTHORING_REFINEMENT.md`](../GRAPH_AUTHORING_REFINEMENT.md) for the decisions.

| Method | Path (prefix `/api/projects/{id}`) | Body / response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/authoring` | `{agents:AgentRecord[],graphs:GraphRecord[],errors:string[]}` |
| GET | `/models/{harness}` | Real `ModelCatalog`; optional `?refresh=true`, no model prompt |
| POST | `/agents` | `{agent:AgentDefinition,revision:""}` → AgentRecord |
| PATCH | `/agents/{slug}` | `{agent:AgentDefinition,revision}` → AgentRecord; supports rename |
| DELETE | `/agents/{slug}` | `{revision}` → `{removed:true}` |
| POST | `/graph-drafts` | `{name,description}` → draft GraphRecord; layout only |
| POST | `/graphs/{id}` | `{definition:GraphDefinition,revision}` → saved GraphRecord |
| PATCH | `/graphs/{slug}` | `{enabled,revision}` → GraphRecord |
| DELETE | `/graphs/{slug}` | `{revision}` → `{removed:true}` |
| POST | `/graphs/{id}/layout` | `{positions:{[elementID]:{x,y}},viewport?:{x,y,zoom}}` → layout |

AgentDefinition's JSON fields are `name`, `description`, `enabled`, `defaultHarness`,
`model`, optional `effort`, and `prompt`. TOML uses `default_harness`. AgentRecord
adds `id`, `revision`, and derived `graphReferences` (graph names), which are not
stored inside the TOML. Model IDs come from real harness catalogs. Configurable
effort requires a supported value; models without configurable effort omit it.
Prompts are multiline TOML strings, not separate prompt files.

GraphRecord is `{id,revision,definition,layout}`. GraphDefinition uses the YAML keys
also in JSON: `name`, optional description text, `enabled`, `initial_node`, `nodes`,
and `choices`. Nodes and Choices are maps keyed by identity. The Go structs in
`authoring.go` are the serialization schema. Node variants:

```yaml
nodes:
  implement:
    type: agent
    name: Implement task
    agent: implementer
    overrides: # optional; only local overrides, never the inherited definition
      harness: codex
      model: selected-model-id
      effort: medium
    choices: [ready, blocked]
  prepare:
    type: terminal
    name: Update repository
    command: git pull
    to: implement
  checks:
    type: fork
    name: Parallel checks
    branches:
      security:
        name: Security review
        git_branch: checks/security
        output:
          task: "{{run.input.task}}"
        to: security-review
      tests:
        name: Test review
        git_branch: checks/tests
        output:
          task: "{{run.input.task}}"
        to: test-review
  integrate:
    type: join
    agent: integrator
    prompt: Follow project integration conventions.
    output_branch: feature/integrated
    choices: [integrated, blocked]
```

This fragment illustrates fields, not a complete executable graph. Agent IDs,
destinations, model IDs and Choices must refer to actual definitions/configuration.
Fork worktree isolation and incoming revision are fixed type rules; this CRUD does
not perform Git operations or define synchronization. Join `prompt` and
`output_branch` are optional. Terminal commands preserve their text and are never
executed by these endpoints.

Choice keys/references use the name-derived slug (`request-changes`), while `name`
retains underscores (`request_changes`). Input is a map of string fields with
`required` flags; output is a flat map of string/template values. Terminal Choices
retain output and cannot have `to` or `session`. Eligible destinations for a session
policy are agent and Join; omission means new. Template output is validated, not
executed here. Graph Save checks settings and references, but is not a declaration
of runtime executability: unfinished/disconnected destinations can be saved.

### Saving, reading and concurrent edits

- Agents are `<slug>.toml`. Graph definitions are `<slug>.yaml`. Companion layout
  files are `<slug>.yaml.layout.json`, with `positions` and optional `viewport`.
  Choice position keys are `choice:<choice-slug>`; other keys are node IDs.
- Create establishes a unique `draft-<id>` layout identity without registering a
  graph. The first Save checks the name-derived target for collisions, writes YAML,
  moves the draft layout to the companion name and removes the old draft layout.
  Abandoned layout-only drafts stay outside the catalog; draft recovery/cleanup UI
  is not included.
- Layout writes are atomic and independent of definition revision. The client
  serializes them, saves positions on drag release and viewport on user move end,
  and waits for them before Save/return. Layout never stores executable connections.
- Definition revisions are hashes of current file bytes. Updates/deletes reject
  stale revisions rather than overwriting newer edits. Renaming a graph moves both
  files; renaming an agent updates saved graph references.
- Referenced agents cannot be deleted or disabled. Graph references are derived
  from YAML, not fixture counters or cached UI state.
- Writes use same-directory temporary files and atomic replacement. Multi-file
  changes use a `.klm/.authoring-transaction.json` roll-forward journal. Reads and
  mutations recover pending transactions under the authoring mutex. A failed
  transaction reports an error; a subsequent access finishes recovery before
  exposing the catalog. This coordinates engine writes, not arbitrary external
  editors writing simultaneously during a transaction.
- Unknown TOML/YAML fields, unreadable files and malformed documents are reported.
  Invalid definitions are not imported as fixtures or silently overwritten.
  Catalog errors block mutations until repaired. Missing layout is supported;
  invalid layout is reported and defaults positions when reading.
- Client paths never determine the project root. IDs are validated, configuration
  symlinks/junctions are rejected, and reads are capped at 2 MiB per file. Existing
  JSON mutation limits apply. These endpoints use the engine's public API boundary.

Validation for this delivery: Go build, TypeScript check, and the requested browser
CRUD round trip in a temporary project. Created a graph with optional description
empty, saved/reopened its terminal node and layout; created/reloaded an agent using
the real Codex catalog, selected it in a graph node, connected it through a terminal
Choice with output, saved/reopened, and disabled/enabled the graph across reloads.
No graph execution, model prompt, full test suite or deep/adversarial review was run.

### Model selection and account quotas

Catalog discovery uses isolated, prompt-free native control processes scoped to the
project directory: Pi RPC plus its installed model-capability library, OpenCode's
authenticated loopback provider/config API, and Codex app-server model pagination.
Catalog responses expose `connectedProviders` (`id`, `name`, `authType`) as an
explicit boundary. Pi derives this from its credential-filtered available snapshot;
OpenCode intersects native connected IDs with authenticated/environment or explicit
provider configuration, excluding automatic free catalogs. Codex's default OpenAI
catalog requires a native account connection. Both engine and picker filter models
against this list. Model IDs include provider identity
for Pi/OpenCode. Session settings reject unavailable models/efforts and active turns.
No global model or thinking defaults are written. Existing CLI model overrides remain
readable; new UI selections come from the actual catalog.

Quota snapshots contain `source`, `observedAt`, `windows` (`name`, `usedPercent`,
`resetsAt` in epoch seconds), and optional `stale`. They are in-memory only and
credential-fingerprint scoped. Codex reads `account/read` and `account/rateLimits/read`
without starting a thread; ChatGPT subscription auth is required. Cross-harness
OpenAI auth must identify the same Codex account.
OpenAI subscription detection recognizes native Codex protocol metadata as well as
the OpenAI/ChatGPT provider IDs; API-key billing and intermediary routes remain
excluded. Ordinary protocol/client headers and non-auth provider settings do not
disqualify a matching OAuth connection.
Claude Code must be installed with
readable OAuth credentials; direct Anthropic OAuth is matched by token or account
and organization from `/api/oauth/profile`, then reads `/api/oauth/usage`.

Anthropic's OAuth usage endpoint is a best-effort provider integration rather than
a documented standalone Claude CLI command. Missing/expired credentials or unsupported
responses yield no new quota. Credential rotation remains owned by the CLI; KLM never
rewrites auth files, logs tokens, sends a model prompt to obtain quota, or queries a
user-supplied quota host. Credential files currently cover Windows/Linux file-backed
CLI installations; OS keychain-only storage is not read. Pi credential helpers for
native Codex-protocol models can be resolved by `pi auth check --credentials --json
--no-refresh`; the returned credential stays inside the engine and must identify the
same Codex account. API keys, intermediary providers, custom auth/route overrides, and unknown
account relationships are hidden instead of showing unrelated subscription limits.
Quota responses may include a non-secret `reason` code when unavailable, such as
`account_mismatch` or `harness_oauth_unavailable`, for diagnostics.

### Token usage details

`usage` is persisted and published through the existing session snapshots. Input
totals include cached tokens; output totals include reported reasoning. Null means
unavailable, and absent usage on older sessions remains unknown until the next run.
Context is a latest available occupancy estimate, not the sum of session totals.
Counts update on harness usage reports, not every streamed text delta.

- Pi: `get_session_stats` provides authoritative session totals, including retained
  pre-compaction history, and `contextUsage`. Requested at startup, after assistant
  messages/compaction, and at settlement (with a bounded final wait). Missing optional
  telemetry does not fail execution.
- OpenCode: native history plus live message/step updates, deduplicated by IDs.
  Step-finish counts take precedence over message counts to avoid counting the same
  call twice. Input adds cache read/write; output adds the separate reasoning bucket.
  Context uses the latest exchange's input + output and the actual model's
  `/provider` context limit. Model lookup failure leaves capacity unknown.
- Codex: `thread/tokenUsage/updated.total` replaces cumulative counts; `last.totalTokens`
  and `modelContextWindow` supply context. Cached input and reasoning output are
  already included and must not be added again.

Compaction invalidates stale occupancy until a fresh usable context report arrives.
Context snapshots may lag new prompts, tool results, or streamed output. No client-side
tokenizer, hardcoded model capacity, or usage inferred from visible text is used.

IDs are opaque strings, and timestamps
are UTC RFC3339 with fractional seconds. Native harness identifiers and Pi's
session path live in a separate private section of `state.json`.

Validation and semantics:

- Project names and grouping folder names are trimmed, 1-60 Unicode characters,
  with no control characters. Duplicate grouping names are rejected
  case-insensitively; `Ungrouped` is reserved. These folders are labels, not
  filesystem directories. `Project.folders` initially equals `[]`.
- Project `folder` must be an existing absolute directory, checked again before
  every execution. Processes always use that directory as their working directory.
- `icon` may be empty. Otherwise it must be a `data:image/png;base64,` URL, at most
  128 KiB for the entire URL, and a fully decodable PNG no larger than 1024x1024.
  The client is responsible for resizing. The pixel bound prevents compressed
  image allocation bombs.
- Session titles are trimmed, 1-200 characters. Optional model IDs are trimmed,
  at most 200 characters, with no control characters or leading `-`.
- `workspace` names an existing project grouping folder or `Ungrouped`. An empty
  or omitted workspace becomes `Ungrouped`. It never changes the process cwd.
- New sessions are idle with `events: []`. The harness must be discoverable when
  creating a session, but availability does not imply authenticated or usable.
- Messages preserve whitespace, cannot be blank or contain NUL, and are capped
  at 128 KiB UTF-8. JSON request bodies are capped at 512 KiB.
- Only one turn per session can run; another message gets 409 until it exits.
  Different sessions may run independently. Linked-agent consultations queue and
  route through the scheduler described below; ordinary user messages are not queued.
- Event IDs remain stable when a harness item is updated. Array ordering is
  first-observed ordering. Item updates replace that item's data/text in place;
  Pi text deltas append. This is not a duplicate raw-event audit log.
- Event status is optional and describes the item, typically `running`,
  `completed`, `error`, `started`, or `cancelled`. Tool errors do not by themselves
  fail a turn, because a harness may recover. Explicit turn/assistant errors do.
- SSE uses default `data: <Session JSON>\n\n` events, not named events. It sends the
  current snapshot immediately, plus 15-second comment heartbeats. Slow clients
  may skip intermediate snapshots, but the latest snapshot includes every stored
  event. Reconnect simply receives the latest state; no Last-Event-ID is needed.

## Harness Adapters

Discovery runs at engine startup without sending any prompts or reading auth
files. Executable overrides are optional: `KLM_PI_BIN`, `KLM_OPENCODE_BIN`, and
`KLM_CODEX_BIN`. Each is a single executable path/name, not a shell command or
argument string. A Pi override can instead point to `cli.js`, requiring Node.js
on PATH. Invalid overrides make that adapter unavailable; they do not fall back.

On Windows, discovery checks `%APPDATA%\npm\node_modules`, npm package locations
adjacent to discovered PATH shims, native `.exe` files on PATH, and Codex's
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\OpenAI\Codex\bin\codex.exe`. Pi's installed package is
`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent/dist/cli.js`; OpenCode's is
`opencode-ai/bin/opencode.exe`. No user-specific absolute installation paths are
hardcoded. `.cmd`, `.bat`, and `.ps1` shims are never executed or parsed.

All prompts are supplied verbatim through stdin and EOF, never shell-interpolated
or placed in command arguments. Model and native session identifiers are separate
argv entries. Children inherit the environment and use their harness's existing
authentication/configuration. The engine neither obtains nor returns credentials.

### Pi 0.80.6

```text
node <pi-cli.js> --mode rpc --no-extensions --extension <owned-extension.ts> --session <absolute-session.jsonl> [--model <model>]
```

One RPC process per turn; subsequent turns use the same session file at
`<data-dir>/sessions/<KLM-session-id>.jsonl`. Before prompting, the engine requires
both the approval extension's readiness notification and a validated get_state
response. The embedded extension gates every agent-dispatched tool_call using a
cancellable RPC UI selection. Unknown interactive dialogs fail closed. Responses
are sent over stdin, not inferred from stdout tool notifications.

`message_update.assistantMessageEvent` text/thinking deltas append to the correct
content-index item. `message_end` replaces each item with final text/thinking and
checks `stopReason`/`errorMessage`, even when the CLI exits zero.
`tool_execution_start`, `tool_execution_update`, and `tool_execution_end` share an
event; accumulated partial results replace rather than append. Bash is a command
event. `agent_settled` marks completion. Duplicate user messages, full `agent_end`
message copies, and turn boundary copies are not added to the UI history.

Pi is **not sandboxed** by this engine. The approval extension gates agent tool
dispatch, not arbitrary extension code or OS calls. Third-party extension discovery
remains disabled so later handlers cannot mutate arguments after approval. This
also disables extension-provided MCP tools. No ungated print-mode fallback exists.

### OpenCode 1.18.30

```text
opencode.exe serve --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 0 --mdns=false
```

An owned loopback server is started per turn with random HTTP Basic credentials.
The engine uses directory-scoped HTTP/SSE directly, not `run --attach`, which
would still auto-reject prompts. Native session IDs are reused after directory
validation. It subscribes before posting prompt_async, tracks message/part IDs,
streams text/reasoning/tools, and reconciles final history without duplicating old
messages. Idle completes the turn; individual step-finish events do not. Stream
loss fails and aborts the turn rather than silently replaying actions.

History is read with `limit`/`before` and the native `X-Next-Cursor` header.
Pages start at 64 messages and shrink if a response exceeds KLM's 32 MiB bound.
Initial hydration retains message IDs and usage metadata, discarding old message
bodies after each page. Final reconciliation reads backwards only until the
pre-turn baseline, then processes the current turn in chronological order.
History JSON is projected while reading: only tool `state.metadata.diff` and
`state.metadata.files[].patch` strings larger than 64 KiB are replaced by an
explicit omission marker in KLM's copy. Small previews, file names, change counts,
diagnostics, tool input/output/status and usage remain intact. The native OpenCode
history and model context are not modified. The original bytes still travel over
HTTP; discarded preview strings are scanned without accumulating them in memory.
Pages retain a 32 MiB JSON bound after projection and a separate 256 MiB input
bound; either bound reduces the page size before failing on a single message.
HTTP JSON errors identify the method and endpoint without query values or bodies.
This projection applies to history HTTP responses; live SSE frames retain their
separate 2 MiB bound. Native runtime validation remains a human check. Focused
unit tests cover pagination, metadata projection, usage totals and diagnostics.

Permission asked/replied events create/remove pending cards. Positive choices
always send native `once`; KLM owns remembered scopes. Native `always` is not used
because its in-memory cache can affect other sessions in the same instance.
Existing plugins/config and explicit denials are respected. Native question events
are routed to question cards. Tools already allowed by native rules do not require
a permission card.

### Codex 0.142.5

```text
codex.exe app-server --listen stdio://
```

The engine initializes JSONL RPC, starts/resumes the stored thread with read-only
sandboxing and on-request/user approvals, then starts the turn. Native IDs and
working directories are validated; no replacement thread is silently created.
Text/reasoning/output deltas update stable items and completed snapshots replace
them. Turn completion, not process exit, ends execution.

Command and file-change requests receive accept/decline only. Permission-profile
requests preserve all requested access and deny entries; native grants have a
minimum **turn** lifetime, labeled in the UI. Recognized empty MCP approval forms
support one-shot consent only when resource identity is ambiguous. Unsupported
forms, URLs, legacy/dynamic-tool requests are declined or failed, never
answered affirmatively. No native session or global policy amendments are used.

Native item/tool/requestUserInput requests are handled as questions, not approvals.
The engine enables `features.default_mode_request_user_input=true` and
`tools.experimental_request_user_input.enabled=true` through child-only CLI flags.
This Codex feature is under development in 0.142.5; no global config, collaboration
mode, or model is changed.

## Permission Decisions

Session snapshots include optional pending `permissions` entries with id, harness,
kind, title, description, patterns, details, decisions, allowLabel, createdAt and
resolving. IDs bind to the active engine turn and native request. Client payloads
contain a choice only, never raw native responses. Concurrent/stale decisions are
rejected; stop and restart invalidate pending requests.

- `once`: approve the native request without an engine rule. Codex permission
  profiles last for the current turn, not one operation.
- `session`: persist an exact grant for the logical KLM session.
- `always`: persist an exact grant for this project and harness, across sessions.
- `reject`: deny the native request. The harness may recover or stop.

Remembered grants use a hash of the full semantic action/resource scope plus
project, harness and permission kind. No wildcard expansion or parent-directory
inference is performed. All request patterns/arguments must match. Ambiguous
requests disable remembered choices. Grant persistence succeeds before a request
is released; delivery failures roll back the new grant. Pending requests are not
replayed after restart. A permission audit entry is included in session events.

Grants are stored in `state.json`'s permissionGrants field. They do not modify
global harness settings. There is no grants-management UI in this first slice;
session grants end when that logical session is no longer used, not at every turn.

## Question Tools

Session `questions` entries contain id, harness, items, createdAt, and resolving.
Each item contains id, header, text, options (label/description), multiple, custom,
and secret. Responses are positional `answers:string[][]`, one array per item;
the engine maps them back to each harness's native identifiers and labels.
Requests are tied to the active turn. Unknown choices, empty answers, duplicates,
unsupported multi-selection, stale IDs, and duplicate submissions are rejected.
Dismissal returns no default answer. Pending questions are cleared on stop/restart.
Answers do not affect permission grants. The answer audit is recorded in history;
private fields are masked there but sent to the receiving harness. Its own records
or model output may retain/echo values; this is not end-to-end secret redaction.

- OpenCode: handles question.asked/replied/rejected, GET /question reconciliation,
  and ordered native reply/reject endpoints. Custom entry defaults to allowed;
  multiple comes from the request. Native question registration is enabled on the
  owned server. Old CLI-run sessions may still deny question; use a new session
  rather than overriding intentional native permission rules.
- Pi: the owned extension registers sequential `ask_user` with structured questions,
  options, custom text, and multiple selection. Only this tool bypasses the redundant
  tool-permission gate. A versioned `klm.question.v1:` RPC input envelope carries
  the form, and JSON answer arrays return to the actual tool result. Other tools
  remain gated. Cancelled questions are explicitly reported as dismissed.
- Codex: native questions preserve IDs, offered choices, isOther/isSecret, native
  RPC IDs and resolution/expiry notifications. Replies map each question ID to
  `{answers:[...]}`. No native multiple flag is inferred from array-shaped answers.
  Malformed requests return empty answers and a warning, not fabricated consent.

## Linked-Agent Conversations

`Session.parentId` attaches exactly one side conversation to a main session in the
same project. Creation is idempotent under the engine mutex, including concurrent
clients. `/api/state` includes both; the client filters children out of its top-level
list. Main and side have independent native IDs/files and harness/model settings.
Switching a side harness is allowed only before any events or active execution.

Side messages accept up to eight source references from the parent conversation,
with at most 128 KiB of selected text total. Passages are never truncated. The engine
checks source IDs and attaches deterministic JSON reference context: project/main
identity, exact passages, each source and up to two neighboring events on each side
(2 KiB per surrounding event). A selection-free first turn includes the latest six
events with the same bound. The user question stays separate from reference material.
Original selected text and source references persist with the user event and session.

Shared tools, available to all three harnesses:

- `linked_discover`: caller/linked identity, role, project, harness and execution status.
- `linked_read`: only the linked conversation, latest ten events by default, maximum
  twenty per call; `cursor`/`nextCursor` page history, `messageId` targets a source,
  `offset`/`nextOffset` page long text in 4,096-character chunks. No native paths or
  arbitrary session targets are exposed.
- `linked_ask`: explicit short `topic` (120 characters) and `question` (32 KiB).
- `linked_answer`: `requestId` and `answer` (64 KiB), accepted only in the recipient's
  actual active consultation turn, then the agent is instructed to finish that turn.

Each execution owns a random-capability, authenticated loopback Streamable HTTP MCP
server with four tools. Access is bound to that turn and its linked counterpart;
capabilities are not placed in engine state and expire when the process finishes.
OpenCode dynamically registers `klm_linked` on its owned server and confirms connection
and tool-list readiness. Codex receives child-only `mcp_servers.klm_linked` overrides
and confirms the tool inventory through `mcpServerStatus/list` before starting a turn.
Pi's bundled temporary extension exposes the same operations and verifies the inventory
before its existing readiness notification. Linked communication tools bypass Pi's
redundant per-tool permission dialog. Codex automatically accepts native tool-call
approval forms for the ready, turn-owned `klm_linked` bridge; OpenCode automatically
replies `once` to permission requests matching its four exact internal tool names.
These internal operations never create permission cards or remembered grants. The
policy does not apply to other MCP servers or arbitrary elicitation forms, and
filesystem/shell tools remain gated. No user/global
installation or native transcript-format translation is required.

The installed versions inspected for this feature were OpenCode 1.18.30 and Codex
0.153.4; Codex's generated local app-server schema confirms the status-list contract.
Runtime readiness checks fail explicitly if an installed harness cannot expose the tools.

Requests persist in `state.json.consultations`, with question, answer, topic, endpoint
IDs, timestamps, status (`queued`, `answering`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`,
`interrupted`), and delivery state. Both sessions receive atomically updated activity
events. Background output and permission/question answer audits carry `consultationId`
so the client groups the recipient's background answering work under the relevant
activity. The requester's resumed response is shown as ordinary chat messages,
including for previously saved consultations; its correlation ID is retained.
Native consultation prompts and outputs still enter the recipient's native history.

Idle recipients start immediately; busy recipients wait for the current turn to finish.
Tool requests wait at most five seconds, safely below HTTP timeouts. Reciprocal requests
yield immediately. If no terminal result arrives within that wait, the tool instructs
the requester to finish its turn; the engine starts a correlated continuation when
it is idle. No same-session parallel turn or polling loop is needed. At most four
questions may be outstanding per requester; identical pending questions deduplicate.
Tool results explicitly carry `action: "continue"` with terminal answers/failures
or `action: "yield"` while still pending. A reply present when the five-second wait
expires takes precedence over yielding and includes the full answer. Resumed prompts
explicitly replace the earlier yield instruction and ask the requester to use the
answer without another user follow-up.
Unanswered requests expire after ten minutes, including queue time. Stop cancels linked
requests involving that conversation; per-activity cancellation targets one request.
Failed/stopped requester turns suppress unattended continuations. Shutdown and restart
retain terminal interruption state rather than replaying background work; an answer
already persisted before restart remains readable even if its continuation was interrupted.

Manual validation: open from header and selection; reopen history; add later passages;
resize with pointer/keyboard and narrow layouts; test different-harness pairs in both
directions; queue against busy recipients; cancel, stop, and restart during consultation.
Only lightweight Go/desktop builds are part of implementation validation, not live model
execution, a full suite, or an adversarial review.

## Persistence And Recovery

- `state.json` holds projects, sessions, events, and the private native-session
  map. Every published mutation is serialized under a mutex and written to a
  same-directory temporary file, synced, closed, then atomically replaced.
- Windows replacement uses `MoveFileExW(REPLACE_EXISTING | WRITE_THROUGH)`.
  Unix uses rename plus parent-directory sync. Use a local filesystem with normal
  atomic rename/sync semantics, not a network share or cloud-synced data directory.
- In-memory state changes and SSE notifications happen only after persistence
  succeeds. A write failure preserves the last published snapshot, cancels active
  executions, blocks further mutations, and makes health return 503. Fix the
  underlying storage problem and restart; no automatic overwrite/retry is done.
- `engine.lock` is held exclusively by an OS file lock/handle for the engine's
  lifetime. It contains a diagnostic PID, but ownership is not inferred from the
  PID. Kernel lock release on process exit handles stale files safely. Do not
  delete the lock file while an engine is running.
- Startup refuses malformed/unsupported state instead of resetting it. Sessions
  left running become `error` with a durable interruption event. Native harness
  transcripts remain owned/formatted by the harness itself; they are not part of
  the engine JSON transaction, and a stopped turn may have partial native history.
- Stop/shutdown cancel the direct child and use Windows `taskkill /T /F` on that
  owned PID only. Unix children use a separate process group. The stop response
  waits for termination and the durable cancelled snapshot; there is no replay of
  the cancelled prompt. Force-killing the engine itself cannot run cleanup and
  may leave external children, which are not blindly killed by PID on restart.
- Output is consumed concurrently from stdout and stderr. JSON lines are capped
  at 2 MiB and total stdout at 32 MiB per turn; hitting a limit cancels the turn
  with an explicit error. Stderr is capped at 16 KiB and is never persisted,
  exposed, or logged. Exit failures report a bounded generic diagnostic instead.
- Session history is durable and unbounded across turns. This first implementation
  rewrites the full state per event, intentionally favoring simplicity over large
  histories/high token throughput. There is no retention, deletion, or compaction
  API yet. Back up the data directory with the engine stopped.

## Network and Private Control Boundaries

The public API binds `0.0.0.0:7331`, including LAN clients. Host accepts IP addresses,
localhost or the Windows computer name on port 7331. CORS accepts HTTP Focus on
the API's same hostname, port 7332 (loopback aliases are interchangeable), Tauri's
native origin, and HTTP(S) loopback Vite origins on 5173/4173. Opaque/null origins
remain rejected; requests without Origin are accepted. CORS does not grant
credentials and is not network authentication. JSON mutation limits remain intact.

Network authentication and TLS are explicitly deferred in the approved personal-use
delivery. The existing `loopbackHost` helper, private authenticated MCP bridge and
owned harness endpoints retain their local boundary. Engine shutdown is available
only through a named pipe whose ACL allows this Windows user and denies network
logons. Grants, permissions and sandbox behavior remain unchanged.

The engine never reads auth stores, prints environment values, or exposes binary
paths/command lines through discovery. Harness-generated tool/message content
can still contain sensitive project information and is shown/stored as content;
this is not a general-purpose content redaction system. Protect the data directory
with user-only OS permissions. State is plaintext, not encrypted.

The native directory picker is Windows-only. It runs a fixed PowerShell
`-NoProfile -NonInteractive -STA` WinForms `FolderBrowserDialog` script with UTF-8
stdout and no user interpolation. Dialogs are serialized, have a five-minute
timeout including queue time, and return only an existing absolute path or null
on dismissal. Request cancellation/shutdown kills the owned picker process tree.
Other platforms return 501 for this endpoint; Unix support has not been validated.

## Validation Scope

Installed Pi source and harness CLI help were inspected without sending prompts.
The implementation is intended for a lightweight Go build followed by manual
HTTP, picker, SSE, stop/restart, and authenticated chat validation. No tests or
test suites are included or run as part of this slice.

## Graph execution core (P1–P5)

Graph authoring remains separate from executable compilation. Runs snapshot the
graph YAML and referenced agent TOMLs, resolve real model/effort settings, and
retain those definitions through catalog edits. The compiler checks complete
destinations, output references, normal Fork reconvergence and Join contracts.
Layout is optional. Ordinary cycles are allowed; nested Forks are rejected.

The main conversation's private harness bridge exposes `graph_catalog`,
`graph_activities`, `graph_get_run`, `graph_recent_events`, `graph_invoke`,
`graph_assess` and `graph_update_activity`. The side conversation gets the four
read-only tools. There is no public HTTP invocation or orchestrator Stop tool.
Selecting a graph, selecting None and opening Graph never execute or cancel work.

Invocation records an express user-message authorization reference, self-contained
task, objective and resolved workspace decision. `authorization` is a list of
`{eventId,text}` references grounding the activity. Each event must exist, have type
`user`, and belong to the invoking conversation. The reference is traceability,
not semantic proof of consent or a native permission grant. The orchestrator
instructions enforce the distinction.
Activities use versions and operation IDs; duplicate operations do not dispatch
another run. Ready correction takes priority, then explicit priority and request
order. Dependencies wait for an explicit satisfied assessment of their objective;
normal completion alone does not release them. Blocked/failure/interruption cannot
satisfy a success prerequisite. A retry requires concrete correction and the
user's fresh/reuse decision when earlier artifacts/workspaces are involved.

### Invocation contract update — approved 2026-09-13

The latest decision in refinement section 13 supersedes the earlier requirement
to ask for a workspace mode and supply `workspace.authorizationEventId` on every
invocation. Incomplete nested `graph_invoke` schemas had left the agent guessing
`path`, `scope` and event identifiers against strict engine validation.

- Omitting `workspace` resolves to `original` without asking. The product default
  is the basis for that resolution; omission must not be represented as express
  consent or as a message in which the user chose that directory.
- Explicit `workspace.mode: "original"` and `"new_worktree"` remain available.
  `original` uses the registered project directory and its actual file state,
  including when it is already a worktree. It does not take an arbitrary `path`.
- `workspace.authorizationEventId` is not mandatory. Activity `authorization`
  remains required with the `{eventId,text}` shape above; it is not replaced by
  `scope` or by a required workspace-choice event.
- Publish complete nested schemas through MCP and Pi, with field types,
  required/optional fields, mode/attempt enums, defaults, descriptions and reuse
  map values. The workspace contract includes `mode`, `attempt`, optional
  `authorizationEventId`, `baseRevision`, `sourceRunId` and `reuse` associations;
  retain the applicable fresh/reuse conditions rather than marking every field
  mandatory. Validation and the published schemas must agree.
- Orchestrator instructions apply defined defaults and ask only for blocking
  ambiguity or missing information. A new worktree still uses the requested
  revision or current local HEAD by default, without a mandatory revision question.
- Retrying with earlier artifacts still requires the user's fresh/reuse decision
  and concrete correction; reuse still requires explicit associations. If that
  decision is missing, ask. Fresh in the original directory retains W2's existing-
  files behavior without reset or automatic worktree creation.

This section records the approved contract for the parallel Go implementation,
not evidence that its new default/schemas are running. See
`GRAPH_ENGINE_PROGRESS_INVOCATION_DOCS.md` at the repository root. The user will
reload the tab and retest after the principal agent coordinates the restart.

### Run lifecycle and execution

Each run has its own context and occupies its conversation slot during `starting`,
`running` and `ending`. The initiating chat turn can finish or keep conversing.
Node sessions are private, with explicit run/node ownership and canonical cwd.
Continued sessions are reused only for the latest visit to that node in the same
run, same directory and harness, after the adapter reports them continuable.
Questions and permissions retain their originating private-session callbacks and
are projected into the owning conversation, including when Graph is hidden.

Only a valid Choice can finish an agent/Join node. The engine's
`{origin:"engine",id:"blocked"}` is distinct from every author Choice. Invalid
payloads and normally ended turns missing a Choice share a deduplicated counter
per activation: two corrections, failure on the third. The core persists
reservation/sealed/drained/accepted phases. No acceptance callback dispatches work;
the supervisor continues only after the adapter's final `Finished` callback.

Terminal runs one noninteractive PowerShell script in the inherited workspace.
`$payload` is loaded from a private UTF-8 JSON file; values are never pasted into
the script. The output mapper supports local `payload.<field>`, `command.result`
and `run.input.task` references. Stdout/stderr are combined in observed order and
bounded to 64 KiB UTF-8 with explicit truncation metadata. A nonzero shell exit
continues through the configured mapping; process-start/collection failures fail
the run. There is no task timeout or interactive Terminal input.

Git operations use argument arrays and owned processes. New worktrees live under
`<data-dir>/worktrees/<project-id>/<workspace-id>` and use unique run/activation
branch suffixes. An intent is persisted before creation. Fork fixes one incoming
commit for its isolated branches; branches without isolation share inherited cwd,
branch and dirty state. No implicit commit, push, pull, checkout of the original
directory, reset, dirty-file copy or cleanup is performed. Fresh in the original
directory intentionally uses existing files. Reuse explicitly maps `initial` and
`node:<node-id>:<occurrence>[:branch:<branch-id>]` to prior workspace IDs; repository,
source-run usage and managed-branch provenance are checked.

Join collects distinct payloads by incoming connection and causal round; `{}` is
an arrival. It starts its agent only when all inputs arrived, rejects duplicate
independent arrivals/overlapping rounds, and agrees incoming Choice session policy
(Terminal does not vote). Without output branch it integrates at the parallel
origin. With output branch it creates a new integration worktree from that origin's
current local HEAD. The agent integrates and resolves conflicts; the engine never
merges automatically. Continued work uses the integration directory. Missing
inputs with no remaining producer fail with a dependency diagnostic; user waits
are still active work, not deadlock.

Terminal results and slot release are committed with a persistent notification
outbox only after owned work settles. Notifications share the existing linked/user
turn arbiter and cannot overlap native turns. Failed/uncertain notification sends
retry with the same ID; effects are idempotent, not an exactly-once distributed
transaction. Preflight failures have persistent activity-error notices. Startup
preserves scheduled work/outbox and interrupts in-flight runs, activations and
workspace intents without replaying them. Workspace artifacts and native IDs stay.

Adapter preflight is authoritative per harness/platform. Implemented mechanisms
are exposed by `GraphAdapterCapabilities`; they are not a claim of native runtime
validation. Unconfirmed node/tool-call completion keeps a run in `ending` with a
concrete diagnostic instead of releasing its slot as if termination were confirmed.

### External MCP lifecycle boundary — approved 2026-09-13

Refinement section 14 supersedes the preventive OpenCode/Codex configuration ban
reported as `cannot confirm lifecycle ... agentdeck`. A configured external server
alone is not evidence of a pending call. Permit configured MCPs without a server-name
allowlist and without disabling them; this is not an `agentdeck`-only exception.

The engine guarantees the node and its tool calls: prevent new calls after sealing
and await completion of calls actually started before accepting Choice. Shared MCP
server shutdown is not required or guaranteed. A response such as "task started"
completes the call's lifecycle responsibility; the detached remote task continuing
past that response is outside this guarantee and is not thereby deemed successful.

Error/cancellation or loss of the callback without evidence of call completion must
record uncertain finality. Process exit, an empty owned Job, closing the MCP client
or requesting cancellation cannot substitute for a missing call result or prove
remote cancellation. Preserve uncertain-finality handling; do not accept Choice
or report a normal result merely because the local callback/process died.
Grants, native approval flows and sandbox settings remain unchanged.

The adapter implementer owns the parallel implementation. This contract update
does not claim a new build, test or restart. The principal coordinates the requested
restart after the build, then the user reloads the tab and retests. See
`GRAPH_ENGINE_PROGRESS_EXTERNAL_MCP_DOCS.md` at the repository root.

Internal instructions live in `engine/prompts/` and are reread for every send.
Development uses that source directory. Packaged engines can include a sibling
`prompts/` directory or set `KLM_PROMPTS_DIR`. Missing/empty prompts fail explicitly.
With `go -C engine build`, the resulting `engine/engine.exe` also has the existing
`engine/prompts/` as its sibling resource directory. Neither default lookup relies
on the server's working directory. For an explicit development override, from the
repository root use `$env:KLM_PROMPTS_DIR = (Resolve-Path .\engine\prompts).Path`
before launching the engine. No prompt is read as a package-initialization side
effect; the factory is registered in `init()` and prompts are loaded when needed.
See `GRAPH_ENGINE_PROGRESS_CORE.md` and `GRAPH_ENGINE_PROGRESS_ADAPTER.md` at the
repository root for integration contracts and actual verification evidence.
